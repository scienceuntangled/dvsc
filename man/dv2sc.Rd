}
\arguments{
\item{x}{datavolley or data.frame: a datavolley object as returned by \code{\link[datavolley:read_dv]{datavolley::read_dv()}}, or the plays component of that object}

\item{destfile}{string: destination file name. If \code{NULL}, the function will return the raw XML rather than the filename}

\item{home_team_short}{string: the short name to use for the home team. If missing or \code{NULL}, the \code{home_team_id} from \code{x} will be used}
